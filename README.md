# Automated Train and Test validation Dataset 

Usually, working with image data on sites like kaggle, zindi etc allows that image data is segmented into train and validation data. However, during local development, we usually have one directory with subdirectories of the different classes of an image dataset. Some people try to manually create a train and validation directory and move images within these two directories. Well, we made that easy

## Work In Progress

- Input the root directory 
- When prompted input your train dataset size
- Automatically disregards any files that are not image files
- Sit back and enjoy

### Testing Still in Progress
- testing different image file formats
- variable train and test sizes 

This is simply to make it easy to use ImageDataGenerator in tensorflow

## Installation
